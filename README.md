# SM Make PWA

WordPress is a powerful CMS that powered more than 40% website worldwide. It's simple, easy to extends and yet so flexible.

You can create almost anything using it. The most use case is Blog and E-Commerce site.

But rise of Mobile Application and Desktop Application (For SME's Owner) forced the WordPress developer like me to think how to solve the problem of "Can we turn this website into an App?"

The answer is Yes and No.

I don't have much time to debate about the No answer (You can find why No in other website). But this plugin will answer the Yes.

Yes, your WordPress site can be turned into a downloadable application.

## How can I use this plugin?

1. Simply download this plugin by clicking the Green Button named `<> Code`. Then click `Download ZIP`.

2. Then upload it on your desired website.

3. After activate the plugin, you can go to your homepage. And the PWA icon will appear on you URL screen. Please check the icon like `Computer with arrow`.

## Compatible

This plugin is not tested with all of WordPress plugin. But please deactive the plugin if you found a bug and report it to me Via Github Issues.

## How to contribute in this project?

As you know, I'm making this project as a Open-source project. Therefore this repository I make it public. To allow a smart & experience developer like you to help me.

Here's the functionalities that I think would be great if have.

1. Dynamic PWA Name. For now, the PWA Name for each user is static. Using my plugin name. Refer to file named `manifest.json`.

2. Make a new setting for user to insert their desired name in the Admin Dashboard. Then save it at `wp_options`.
